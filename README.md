# Shuffle Due Dates for OmniFocus

I made this OmniFocus plugin to assign a random due date to any selected tasks or projects for 5-35 days out from today. With your task or project selected simply select **Automation > Shuffle Due Dates** from the menu. A new, random due date will be assigned to every selected project or task.

My goal was the replicate the random "dice roll" date change option you get with the iOS version of the app. I'm not sure why the desktop version doesn't have this feature. I've always liked it, particularly for tasks that don't have any real-world urgency but would benefit from some kind of due date.

To install this just download the `.omnijs` file and double-click it. It should open in OmniFocus automatically.
